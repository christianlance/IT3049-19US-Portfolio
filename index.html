    <p>I am a 2nd year IT student in the Simulation & 
        Game Development track. I am 23 years old and gaming has been a passion of mine <br> for 
    as long as I can remember.  I have previously worked in Pharmacy for 3 years and currently work as a Lyft 
Driver. </p>

<h3>Work and Development Experience</h3>
<p> During highschool, I worked consistently in the fast food industry.
    Upon graduating, I immediately started working as a Pharmacy Technician for Kroger when I got accepted to UC under the UC pre-pharmacy program.
After 2 years of undergrad, I became a Pharmacy Intern at Kroger. After 1 year of Pharmacy School, I switched my major to Biochmistry.  3 months later, I 
decided to switch to IT. I am currently working as a Lyft driver and have no professional experience in the IT field.</p>
